          It&apos;s a three-person dance — always exactly three. The three
          dancers hold a tight line, and the front position keeps changing
          hands: one steps up for a short solo, slides back into the line, and
          the next one takes the front. Eight seconds of choreography is really
          four handoffs and a finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name is a casting joke. Three people, in red, blue and green,
          moving to a squeaky chipmunk vocal reads instantly as Alvin, Simon and
          Theodore — you don&apos;t need costumes for people to get it. It
          isn&apos;t an official Alvin and the Chipmunks routine and no one
          involved with the films made it; it&apos;s a fan dance that borrowed
          the characters&apos; format.

          The routine is credited to the ICM Triplets (@icm_triplets). Their
          post carried the note dc: us (dance credit: us) and the tags
          #thechipmunks, #thechipettes and #rightround. TikTok lists the audio

          A year later the same trio posted it again, captioned &quot;Here I
          come&quot;, tagged #alvin, #simon and #theodore. Dancers who copied it
          started crediting them by name, which is when the choreography settled

          In mid-October the dance jumped out of dance accounts. Siblings,
          roommates and friend groups filmed it, usually in red, blue and green.
          One of the versions that carried the wave was posted on 17 October by
          @athenaa_c with her two siblings.

          The routine comes with a group costume built in, so trios used it as
          their costume reveal in the run-up to 31 October. That is why search
          interest kept climbing after the first spike instead of fading.

          If your trio is in three different cities, or nobody has time to
          rehearse, you can build the routine from photos instead of filming.
          Duos who film in person can still split the four handoffs and drop the
          third solo — the AI path on this page maps the full three-person

          The audio is a chipmunk-voice cover of &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a
          Record)&quot;, the 1984 Dead or Alive single, credited on TikTok as
          &quot;The Chipmunks&quot;. The sped-up, high-pitched version is what
          makes the dance recognisable in half a second — a clean recording of
          the original doesn&apos;t land the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page doesn&apos;t bundle the track. Videos download silent, and
          you attach the sound inside TikTok, Reels or Shorts, where the licence
          and the available versions are handled by the platform and vary by
          country.
